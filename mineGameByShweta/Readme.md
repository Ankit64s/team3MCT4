**Minesweeper Game**ðŸ’£

Overview -

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game that became popular on early Microsoft Windows operating systems. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. The board is divided into a grid of cells, and each cell can be in one of three states: revealed, unrevealed, or flagged.

**Objective of the Game**

The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board with hidden mines without explosions by randomly matching the number of nearby mines in each field. The goal of the Minesweeper game is to bypass the mines hidden on the field and find all the safe places. Each time you open a square, your chances of finding a mining increase by one percent, and if you find one, it means itâ€™s game over. 
If you click on a square that has a mine as a neighbor, the mine will be revealed. If you click on an empty square, you will see how many mines are next to that square. Now you need to enter how many mines are hidden in each of the 16 empty squares by clicking on them one at a time.
You have to use numbers to figure out which empty squares contain mine and which ones are safe to click on. In more difficult levels, you will have to mark the squares that you think contain mine until you confirm that they are. If you think there might be a mine hidden underneath the square, you can right-click the square to flag it.
When you start playing Minesweeper, numbers appear on each square. To know how many mines are in a minesweeper game, you first need to know how many cells are on the board. To win the game, you have to find all the mine-free cells in Sabah according to the rules of the minesweeper game.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

Board Initialization:
The game starts with a rectangular grid of cells.
A certain number of mines are randomly placed on the grid.

Gameplay:
The player clicks on a cell to reveal its content.
If the revealed cell contains a mine, the game ends, and the player loses.
If the revealed cell is empty, it displays the number of mines in its adjacent cells.

Adjacent Cells:
Cells can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The number on an empty cell indicates how many mines are present in its neighboring cells.

Flagging Mines:
The player can flag a cell if they suspect it contains a mine.
This helps the player keep track of potential mine locations.
Flagged cells cannot be revealed unless the player removes the flag.

Winning:
The player wins when all non-mine cells are revealed.
The game may include a timer or a scoring system to encourage faster completion.

Losing:
The player loses if they reveal a cell containing a mine.
To create a Minesweeper game as a project, you can follow these steps:

Design the Board:
Create a grid to represent the game board.
Decide on the size of the board and the number of mines.

Place Mines:
Randomly place mines on the board.

Handle Clicks:
Implement logic for handling player clicks.
Determine what happens when a cell is clicked (reveal or flag).

Calculate Numbers:
Write a function to calculate and display the numbers on each cell based on the number of adjacent mines.
Check for Win/Loss:
