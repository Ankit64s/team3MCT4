The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board with hidden mines without explosions by randomly matching the number of nearby mines in each field. 

Each time you open a square, your chances of finding a mining increase by one percent, and if you find one, it means itâ€™s game over. 
If you click on a square that has a mine as a neighbor, the mine will be revealed. If you click on an empty square, you will see how many mines are next to that square. Now you need to enter how many mines are hidden in each of the 16 empty squares by clicking on them one at a time.
You have to use numbers to figure out which empty squares contain mine and which ones are safe to click on. In more difficult levels, you will have to mark the squares that you think contain mine until you confirm that they are. If you think there might be a mine hidden underneath the square, you can right-click the square to flag it.
When you start playing Minesweeper, numbers appear on each square. To know how many mines are in a minesweeper game, you first need to know how many cells are on the board. To win the game, you have to find all the mine-free cells in Sabah according to the rules of the minesweeper game.
