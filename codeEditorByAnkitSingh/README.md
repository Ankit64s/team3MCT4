# Code Editor Project

This project is a simple web-based code editor that allows users to write and execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. It includes features such as code editing, copying, clearing, expanding, restoring, and live output display.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Functionalities

### 1. Code Editing

Users can edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in dedicated text areas.

### 2. Code Clearing

Each module has a "Clear" button that allows users to clear the code in that specific module.

### 3. Code Copying

Users can copy the code from each module to the clipboard using the "Copy" button.

### 4. Code Expansion

Clicking the "Expand" button in any module expands that specific module, providing a larger space for code editing.

### 5. Code Restoration

When a module is expanded, the "Expand" button is replaced by the "Restore" button. Clicking the "Restore" button restores the module to its original size.

### 6. Live Code Output

The code output is displayed in real-time in an iframe, allowing users to see the result of their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
